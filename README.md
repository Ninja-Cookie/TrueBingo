## TrueBingo
TrueBingo opens up the Bomb Rush Cyberfunk world, allowing you to go anywhere or do anything in any order you want, designed around use for Bingo related gameplay.

When creating a "New Game", by default, this will place you in "Hideout" with everything avaliable to you, and all the exits accessible. From here, you can go anywhere and do anything, depending on the config you have set up.

### Keep in mind: If you load an existing file, this will make some changes on the file to accommodate for the open world nature of things, such as setting you to Chapter 6. If you don't want existing save files to have this effect applied, don't load them, and / or back them up.

Config files to edit the character, style, and outfit you start as, as well as World settings to disable or enable specific things, such as removing BMX Doors, can be found in the `BepInEx > Config > TrueBingo` folder. Editing these can be done without restarting the game, but does require some type of update to the Stage or file, such as entering a new Stage or loading / creating the file again.
